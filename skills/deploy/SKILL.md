# Deploy Skill

## Overview

This skill guides users through the full lifecycle of deploying
and managing Python web servers and MCP servers on Google Cloud
Run using gapp. It handles everything from initial assessment
through ongoing operations — candidacy evaluation, setup,
deployment, CI/CD, user management, and redeployment.

gapp deploys containerized Python services to Cloud Run with
Terraform. Solutions remain cloud-agnostic — no GCP imports, no
framework dependencies. A `gapp.yaml` file is the only
touchpoint. gapp handles infrastructure, secrets, container
builds, multi-user auth, and credential management.

## Phase 0: Assess the Situation

Before doing anything, figure out where the user is. Call these
in parallel:

- `gapp_list` — see if any solutions are already registered
- `gapp_status` — if in a repo that looks like a solution, check
  its deployment status

Also inspect the current working directory:

- Does `gapp.yaml` exist? → already initialized
- Does `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` exist? → Python package
- Is there an ASGI app or MCP server? Look for uvicorn
  entrypoints, FastMCP, Starlette, FastAPI
- Is there a `Dockerfile`? → may already be containerized

### If gapp.yaml exists (already initialized)

The repo is already a gapp solution. Check status and determine
what phase it's in:

1. Call `gapp_status` to get infrastructure health
2. The status response includes a `next_step` field — this tells
   you exactly what the user needs to do next
3. Present the current state and offer to help with the next step

### If no gapp.yaml (new candidate)

Evaluate whether the repo is a good candidate for gapp:

**Good candidates:**
- Python web server (FastAPI, Starlette, Flask with ASGI)
- Python MCP server (FastMCP with HTTP transport)
- Has a clear ASGI entrypoint (`module.path:app`)
- Needs to be accessible over the internet

**Not a fit:**
- Not Python
- CLI-only tool (no web server)
- No ASGI/HTTP interface
- Already deployed elsewhere and user doesn't want to move

### Cloud Readiness Check (MCP servers)

Before proceeding to init, inspect how the MCP server
authenticates with its backend API. Look at the SDK layer (or
wherever the HTTP client is configured) for how backend
credentials are obtained. Common patterns:

**Pattern A: Reads `Authorization` header from incoming request**
→ Cloud-ready. The credential arrives per-request, which works
with both direct auth and gapp's bearer mediation.

**Pattern B: Reads credential from environment variable or local
file** (e.g., `os.getenv("SOME_TOKEN")` or
`~/.config/tool/token`)
→ **Not cloud-ready.** This pattern assumes single-user local
execution (stdio). If deployed as-is to Cloud Run, you'd have
to bake the backend credential into the container environment —
which means every unauthenticated HTTP request gets full access
to the user's backend account. **Never do this.** Do not suggest
setting the backend credential as a Cloud Run secret env var as
a workaround — it creates an unauthenticated proxy to the
user's account.

**When you detect Pattern B, propose a refactor before
proceeding.** Present it like this:

> Your service reads backend credentials from an environment
> variable / local file. That works for local stdio, but on
> Cloud Run it would mean any request to the URL gets full
> access to your account — there's no incoming auth.
>
> A small refactor makes it work for both local and cloud: the
> SDK accepts an optional token parameter. When provided (from
> an incoming request's Authorization header), it uses that.
> When not provided, it falls back to the environment variable
> for local/stdio use. If neither exists, it raises an auth
> error — not a "missing env var" error, but a proper "no
> credentials" error.
>
> This keeps local stdio working exactly as before, while
> making the service ready for cloud hosting with gapp's
> credential mediation. Want me to make this change?

If the user agrees, make these changes in order:

1. **SDK layer** — modify the function that obtains the backend
   credential (e.g., `get_token()`) to accept an optional
   `token` parameter. Logic:
   - If `token` is provided → use it (cloud/HTTP path)
   - Else if env var is set → use it (local/stdio path)
   - Else → raise an authentication error (not a "missing env
     var" error — the caller isn't authenticated)

2. **SDK client/operations** — thread the optional token through
   to wherever API calls are made, so callers can pass it in.

3. **MCP server layer** — when running in HTTP mode, extract
   the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the incoming
   request and pass it to the SDK. When running in stdio mode,
   pass nothing (falls back to env var).

4. After the refactor, recommend `auth="bearer"` for gapp so
   that credential mediation protects the endpoint.

**Important:** Do not suggest putting the backend credential in
a Cloud Run secret environment variable as an alternative. That
creates an unauthenticated proxy — any request to the service
URL gets the user's backend access with no gatekeeping. The
whole point of this refactor is to ensure credentials arrive
per-request through a mediated auth layer.

**Present gapp to the user:**

> gapp deploys Python web servers and MCP servers to Google Cloud
> Run. Your solution stays cloud-agnostic — no GCP imports, no
> auth code. You add a small `gapp.yaml` to your repo and gapp
> handles everything: infrastructure, secrets, container builds,
> and optionally multi-user auth with credential mediation.
>
> It takes four steps to go from repo to running service:
> init, setup, set secrets, deploy. Each step is idempotent
> and tells you what to do next.
>
> Want to set it up?

## Phase 1: Initialize

`gapp_init` both creates and configures. First call creates
`gapp.yaml`; subsequent calls update settings. Use it anytime
the user wants to change gapp configuration — entrypoint, auth,
secrets, mcp_path, etc.

If the user wants to proceed and there's no `gapp.yaml`:

1. Help them identify the ASGI entrypoint — the `module:app`
   string that uvicorn would use. Look at the code to find it.
2. Call `gapp_init` to create `gapp.yaml`, a `Dockerfile`, and
   register the solution locally.
3. If the service needs secrets (API keys, tokens), help them
   declare those in `gapp.yaml` under `prerequisites.secrets`.
4. Walk the user through the auth decision (see below).

### Auth Decision

This is a key question. Look at the code to understand how the
service authenticates with its backend (if any), then present the
options.

**Important:** Before presenting these options, you must have
completed the Cloud Readiness Check above. If the service uses
Pattern B (env-var/file-based credentials), the refactor must
happen first — otherwise neither option works safely on Cloud
Run.

**Option A: No auth / direct auth (simpler, good for single-user
or trusted environments)**

The service handles auth itself. Clients pass credentials directly
— either via a configured `Authorization` header in MCP client
settings, or via a parameterized URL. The credential is often the
backend platform's own token (e.g., a Monarch session token, a
TickTick token, an AppSheet API key).

**Prerequisite:** The service must actually read the incoming
request's `Authorization` header (not just an env var). If you
found Pattern B during the Cloud Readiness Check, this option
only works after the refactor — and even then, it means the raw
backend credential is on every client device.

This works well when:
- Single user or small trusted group
- You're OK having the backend token on every machine/client
- You don't need cloud-based clients like Claude.ai (which can't
  set custom headers easily)

**Option B: Credential mediation via gapp's ASGI wrapper
(recommended for multi-device or multi-user)**

gapp injects an auth wrapper at deploy time. Clients authenticate
with a lightweight PAT (personal access token) — a JWT that gapp
issues. The real backend credential (Monarch token, Google OAuth
refresh token, etc.) is stored server-side and never leaves the
server. The wrapper validates the PAT, looks up the real
credential, and rewrites the auth header before the request
reaches the solution. The solution code doesn't change — it still
receives a standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

This is better when:
- You use the service from multiple machines (laptop, phone,
  work computer) — one backend token, many PATs
- You want cloud-based clients like Claude.ai to work (PATs can
  be passed via URL parameter)
- You don't want raw backend credentials scattered across devices
  and agent configs
- You want centralized credential rotation — update the backend
  token once with `gapp_users_update`, every device keeps working
- You want to revoke access without touching the backend credential
- Multiple users need access, each with their own backend credential

Present it to the user like this:

> Your service talks to a backend API using a token. Right now
> that token would go directly in every client's config — your
> laptop, your phone, Claude.ai, etc. If it changes, you update
> everywhere.
>
> Alternatively, gapp can mediate: the real token stays on the
> server, and each client gets a lightweight access token (PAT)
> instead. You can generate new PATs anytime, revoke them
> individually, and rotate the backend token in one place. This
> also makes Claude.ai work — it can't set custom headers but it
> can use a PAT in the URL.
>
> Which approach fits your use case?

If the user chooses mediation, call `gapp_init(auth="bearer")`
(or `auth="google_oauth2"` when the backend credential is a
Google OAuth2 refresh token). The `runtime` field (which version
of the auth wrapper to install in the container) is auto-set
from the installed gapp version — don't ask the user about it.

## Phase 2: GCP Foundation

Call `gapp_status` — if `deployment.project.id` is null, the
response includes `deployment.project.suggestions`:

- `suggestions.default` — a project already labeled for this
  solution in GCP (strongest signal: this solution was previously
  set up there)
- `suggestions.others` — projects used by other local solutions,
  grouped by project ID with solution names

Present suggestions to the user:

1. If `default` is set, recommend it:

   > This solution was previously set up in project `<default>`.
   > Want to use that?

2. If no default but `others` has entries, present them:

   > Your other solutions (X, Y) use project `<id>`. Want to
   > use the same one?

3. If no suggestions at all, ask the user to provide a project
   ID or create one in the Google Cloud Console.

Once confirmed, call `gapp_setup(project_id="the-project-id")`.

This enables APIs, creates a per-solution GCS bucket for Terraform
state, and labels the project. The project ID is remembered for
future commands.

## Phase 3: Secrets

Call `gapp_secret_list` to see what secrets are declared and
their status. For any that aren't populated, ask the user for the
value and call `gapp_secret_set(secret_name, value)`.

Secret values go in Secret Manager, never in the repo. Only
secret names (references) go in `gapp.yaml`.

## Phase 4: Deploy

Two paths — present both and let the user choose:

### Path A: Local Deploy

Requires `terraform` and `gcloud` locally.

Call `gapp_deploy`. Builds a container via Cloud Build and deploys
to Cloud Run via Terraform. Requires a clean git tree —
uncommitted changes block the build. Skips the build if the image
for the current commit already exists.

### Path B: CI/CD (recommended for ongoing use)

Set up once, then deploy from anywhere — GitHub UI, Claude.ai,
phone. No terraform or docker needed locally after setup.

1. `gapp_ci_init(repo="owner/ci-repo")` — designate a private
   CI repo
2. `gapp_ci_setup(solution="name")` — create WIF, SA, push
   workflow
3. `gapp_ci_trigger(solution="name")` — deploy via GitHub Actions

After CI setup, code changes and deployments are decoupled from
the user's machine. Any tool with GitHub access can trigger a
deploy.

**When to recommend CI/CD:**
- User wants to deploy from multiple machines
- User wants cloud-based agents (Claude.ai) to deploy
- User doesn't want terraform installed locally
- User wants automated deployments on push

## Phase 5: Post-Deploy (Auth & Access)

If auth is enabled in `gapp.yaml`, guide through user setup:

1. **Register users** — `gapp_users_register(email, credential)`
2. **Create PATs** — `gapp_tokens_create(email)`
3. **Get connection info** — `gapp_mcp_connect()` generates
   ready-to-use connection commands for Claude Code, Gemini CLI,
   and Claude.ai

The `gapp_mcp_connect` tool shows:
- The service URL
- Registration commands for each client
- Whether each client already has the service registered
- With `user` param, mints a real PAT inline

## Ongoing Operations

### Check status

Use `gapp_status` to check infrastructure health. Returns:
- Deployment state (deployed, not deployed, needs redeploy)
- Service URL
- Health check results
- Guided next steps

Use `gapp_mcp_status` to check MCP-specific health:
- MCP endpoint availability
- Tool enumeration
- Auth status

### Redeploy with changes

After code changes are committed:

- **Path A:** `gapp_deploy` — rebuilds if the commit SHA changed
- **Path B:** `gapp_ci_trigger` — dispatches GitHub Actions

Remind the user: uncommitted changes won't be included. The build
uses `git archive HEAD` for source integrity.

### Manage users

- `gapp_users_list` — see who's registered
- `gapp_users_register` — add a user with their upstream credential
- `gapp_users_update` — change credential or set revoke_before
- `gapp_users_revoke` — delete a user's credential file
- `gapp_tokens_create` — issue a PAT for a user
- `gapp_tokens_revoke` — invalidate all PATs for a user

### List and discover

- `gapp_list` — all registered solutions
- `gapp_list(available=True)` — include remote GitHub solutions
- `gapp_mcp_list` — solutions with MCP endpoints

| `gapp_users_revoke` | Delete user's credential file |
| `gapp_tokens_create` | Create a PAT |
| `gapp_tokens_revoke` | Revoke all PATs for a user |

## Important Reminders

- Every gapp operation is idempotent and returns a `next_step`
  field telling what to do next. Trust it.
- Solutions are cloud-agnostic. Never suggest adding GCP imports
  or auth code to the solution itself.
- One repo = one solution = one Cloud Run service.
- The build uses `git archive HEAD`. Uncommitted changes are never
  included. The working tree must be clean.
- Image tags are the HEAD commit SHA. If the image already exists,
  the build is skipped.
- Secret values go in Secret Manager, never in the repo. Only
  secret names (references) go in `gapp.yaml`.
- When auth is enabled, gapp injects a credential mediation
  wrapper at deploy time. The solution never sees PATs or
  credential files.
- Guide users step by step. Don't dump the entire lifecycle at
  once. Assess where they are and help with the next phase.
- Never suggest setting a backend credential (API token, session
  token, OAuth token) as a Cloud Run secret env var for direct
  use by the service. This creates an unauthenticated proxy.
  Backend credentials must arrive per-request via the
  Authorization header, mediated by gapp's auth wrapper.
- IAM-based auth on Cloud Run is not practical for MCP clients.
  Claude.ai, Gemini CLI, and Claude Code cannot attach IAM
  tokens to requests. Always use gapp's bearer mediation (PATs)
  for access control instead.
