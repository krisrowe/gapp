# gapp — GCP App Deployer

Deploy Python MCP servers to Google Cloud Run with Terraform.

Solution repos remain cloud-agnostic — no GCP imports, no framework dependencies, no auth-aware code. A solution deployed via gapp to Cloud Run works identically when run locally, deployed manually to another cloud, or served without gapp at all. The `gapp.yaml` file is the only touchpoint, and even it is optional metadata — not a code dependency.

gapp handles the full lifecycle: infrastructure, secrets, container builds, multi-user auth, and credential management. Solutions scale to thousands of users without additional engineering, and remain fully isolated from each other even when sharing a GCP project.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
```

From inside a git repo with a Python package:

```bash
gapp init                          # scaffold gapp.yaml, register locally
gapp setup <gcp-project-id>       # enable APIs, create state bucket, label project
gapp secret set <secret-name>     # populate secrets in Secret Manager
gapp deploy                       # build container + terraform apply

# If auth enabled in gapp.yaml:
gapp users register user@example.com <credential>   # register a user
gapp tokens create user@example.com                  # create a personal access token (PAT)
```

Each command is idempotent and tells you what to do next.

## How It Works

1. **`gapp init`** — creates `gapp.yaml` in your repo root and adds a `gapp-solution` GitHub topic. No cloud interaction.

2. **`gapp setup <gcp-project-id>`** — provisions GCP foundation: enables APIs (Cloud Run, Secret Manager, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry), creates a per-solution GCS bucket for Terraform state, and labels the project. The project ID is remembered for future commands.

3. **`gapp secret set <name>`** — stores secret values in GCP Secret Manager, guided by metadata in `gapp.yaml`.

4. **`gapp deploy`** — builds a container image via Cloud Build and deploys to Cloud Run via Terraform. Requires a clean git tree (no uncommitted changes). Skips the build if the image for the current commit already exists.

## The `gapp.yaml` File

Add this to your repo root:

```yaml
service:
  entrypoint: mypackage.mcp.server:mcp_app   # REQUIRED: uvicorn module:app

prerequisites:
  secrets:
    api-token:
      description: "API authentication token"
```

Optional overrides:

```yaml
service:
  entrypoint: mypackage.mcp.server:mcp_app
  memory: "512Mi"       # default
  cpu: "1"              # default
  max_instances: 1      # default
  public: false         # default
  env:                  # default: {}
    LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
  auth:
    enabled: true
    strategy: bearer    # default; or google_oauth2
```

## Additional Commands

```
gapp status [name]                 Show solution health across all phases
gapp plan                          Terraform plan (preview changes)
gapp solutions list [--available]  List local (and optionally GitHub) solutions
gapp solutions restore <name>     Clone from GitHub + find GCP project
gapp secret list                   Show prerequisite secrets and status
gapp users register <email> <credential>  Register a user with upstream credential
gapp users list [--limit] [--start-index]  List registered users
gapp users update <email> [options]        Update credential or set revoke_before
gapp users revoke <email>                  Delete user's credential file
gapp tokens create <email> [--duration]    Create a PAT (JWT) for a user
gapp tokens revoke <email>                 Invalidate all PATs for a user
```

## Key Concepts

- **Solution** — a repo with `gapp.yaml`. One repo = one Cloud Run service.
- **Per-solution bucket** — `gapp-{name}-{project-id}` stores Terraform state. Created by `gapp setup`.
- **GCP project labels** — `gapp-{name}=default` enables auto-discovery on new workstations.
- **GitHub topic** — `gapp-solution` enables discovery via `gapp solutions list --available`.
- **Image tagging** — images are tagged with the HEAD commit SHA. Builds are skipped if the image already exists.
- **Source integrity** — `git archive HEAD` is used as the build source. Uncommitted changes and gitignored files are never included.
- **Credential mediation** — when `auth.enabled`, gapp injects an ASGI wrapper (`gapp-run`) at deploy time that handles JWT-based client auth and upstream credential lookup via GCS FUSE. Solutions remain unaware of the auth layer.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `gcloud` CLI (authenticated)
- `terraform` CLI
- `gh` CLI (for GitHub topic management)

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

## Why gapp

### Cloud-Agnostic Solutions

Solutions never import gapp, never reference GCP, and never contain auth logic. A solution is a standard Python ASGI app that reads an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header — the same interface whether the token comes from a local test client, a direct HTTP caller, or gapp's credential mediation wrapper. This means:

- **Run locally** with `uvicorn myapp:app` and a token in the header
- **Deploy to Cloud Run via gapp** with multi-user auth, credential rotation, and infrastructure managed for you
- **Deploy to any cloud manually** — the app has no GCP coupling to remove
- **Use stdio transport** for local MCP clients with no HTTP at all

gapp is an overlay, not a lock-in.

### Infrastructure You Don't Have to Think About

gapp manages Terraform, IAM, API enablement, service accounts, secret references, and container builds behind four commands. You never write HCL, never enable a GCP API by hand, never create a service account or grant it roles. `gapp setup` handles the foundation, `gapp deploy` handles the rest. If the underlying Terraform modules evolve (new security controls, new resource types), all solutions benefit automatically on their next deploy.

### Multi-User from Day One

When auth is enabled, gapp injects a credential mediation wrapper at deploy time. Each user gets a long-lived personal access token (PAT) and their upstream API credential is stored server-side. The solution never sees PATs or credential files — it receives a standard bearer token on every request.

- **Register users** with `gapp users register` — one credential file per user in GCS
- **Issue PATs** with `gapp tokens create` — signed JWTs, default 10-year duration
- **Rotate credentials centrally** with `gapp users update` — all clients keep working, no PAT reissue needed
- **Revoke access** by deleting the credential file or invalidating all tokens with a timestamp

This scales to tens of thousands of users. Each user is a single small file in GCS (~100 bytes). Lookups are O(1) by email hash. No databases, no user tables, no connection pools.

### Security Isolation

Solutions sharing a GCP project are fully isolated:

- **Per-solution Terraform state** — each solution's infrastructure is independently managed
- **Per-solution service account** — no shared identity
- **Per-secret IAM** — each service account can only access its own declared secrets, not project-wide
- **Per-solution GCS bucket** — credential files and state are in separate buckets
- **Per-solution signing key** — JWT signing keys are auto-generated by Terraform and scoped to the solution

Solutions can share a project (for billing convenience and API enablement) or use separate projects (for stricter blast radius). The framework works identically either way.

### Scalability Without Complexity

The design avoids patterns that require re-engineering at scale:

| Concern | Approach | Why it scales |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| User credentials | One GCS file per user | GCS handles millions of objects; no single-file bottleneck |
| Credential lookup | SHA-256 email hash → file path | O(1), no index, no scan |
| Token caching | In-memory (5-min TTL) + GCS FUSE | 99% of requests hit memory; FUSE handles cross-instance sharing |
| Secret management | GCP Secret Manager per-secret | No central vault; IAM scoped per service account |
| Infrastructure | Terraform with generated tfvars | Declarative, idempotent, no drift between solutions |
| Container builds | Cloud Build + git archive | No local Docker; image tagged by commit SHA |

### Known Limitations

These are conscious tradeoffs in favor of simplicity:

- **User credentials in GCS, not Secret Manager** — GCS lacks audit logging and versioning. Acceptable because per-user credentials are high-cardinality, low-value-per-unit. Deployment secrets (signing keys, API keys) remain in Secret Manager.
- **No self-registration** — an admin must register users via CLI. The future OAuth2 authorization server phase adds self-registration when needed.
- **5-minute revocation window** — in-memory cache TTL means revoked users may retain access for up to 5 minutes. Acceptable for the threat model.
- **GCP-only deployment** — gapp deploys to Cloud Run. Solutions themselves are cloud-agnostic, but the framework's infrastructure automation targets GCP.
